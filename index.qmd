# Pair Trading Strategy

This is a market-neutral, mean-reversion strategy using Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. I plan to trade based on deviations from historical correlation, entering positions when the Z-score of their log price spread becomes extreme.

---

## Outline

- Track the **log price spread** between KO and PEP
- Calculate **Z-score** of the spread
- Enter trades when Z > 2 or Z < -2
- Exit when Z-score returns to 0
- Stop-loss if Z exceeds ±3 or after 5 days (max holding period)

---

# Trading Plan

## Entry Signal
- Compute the **Z-score** of the log-price spread between KO and PEP.
- If `Z > 2`, short KO and long PEP.
- If `Z < -2`, long KO and short PEP.

## Exit Signal
- Exit the trade when Z-score crosses back to **0**.
- OR exit if a **stop loss** is triggered at `Z > ±3`.
- Max hold time: **5 trading days**

## Position Sizing
- **Dollar neutral**: invest equal dollar amounts on both sides.
